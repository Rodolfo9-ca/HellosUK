    City history

  </p>
  <p>
    Belfast is located on the east coast of Northern Ireland. The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills,
    including Cavehill Hill, believed to have inspired Jonathan Swift's novel, The Travels of Gulliver. He imagined that
    it was in the shape of a sleeping giant protecting the city. Belfast is also Located west of the Belfast Lough (Lake
    Belfast / Belfast Estuary) and at the mouth of the River Lagan which
         makes it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it so famous.
