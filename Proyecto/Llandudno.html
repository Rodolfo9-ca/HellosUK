    Llandudno
  </h1>

  <h2>
    City history
  </h2>

  <p>
    The town of Llandudno developed from Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age
    settlements over many hundreds of years on the slopes of the limestone
    headland, known to seafarers as the Great Orme and to landsmen as the
    Creuddyn Peninsula. The origins in recorded history are with the Manor of
    Gogarth conveyed by King Edward I to Annan, Bishop of Bangor in 1284. The
    manor comprised three townships, Y Gogarth in the south-west, Y Cyngreawdr
    in the north (with the parish church of St Tudno) and Yr Wyddfid in the
    south-east.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern Llandudno takes its name from the ancient parish of Saint Tudno but
    also encompasses several neighbouring townships and districts including
    Craig-y-Don, Llanrhos and Penrhyn Bay. Also nearby is the small town and
    marina of Deganwy and these last four are in the traditional parish of
    Llanrhos. The ancient geographical boundaries of the Llandudno area are
    complex: although they are on the eastern side of the River Conwy (the
    natural boundary between north-west and north-east Wales), the ancient
    parishes of Llandudno, Llanrhos and Llangystennin (which includes
    Llandudno Junction) were in the medieval commote of Creuddyn in the
    Kingdom of Gwynedd, and afterwards part of Caernarfonshire. Today, Deganwy
    and Llandudno Junction are part of the town community of Conwy even though
    they are across the river and only linked to Conwy by a causeway and
    bridge.
